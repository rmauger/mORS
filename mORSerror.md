# Search Help

Something went wrong when you tried to use the omnibox (search bar) to search with MORS (for Oregon Revised Statutes), so you ended up here.

Some searches that will work:

* ORS Chapters:
  * Type into browser omnibox: `mors ORS 659A`
  * It will work without the ORS: `mors 91`

* ORS Sections:
  * Type: `97.200`
  * Or: `72a.3070`

*  

* You can type a string a valid terms separated by anything (or almost nothing, if they don't overlap)
  * E.g. `9.460 ; 701 / 2019 c.444`

If something seems broken, email mOrs.Development@gmail.com
